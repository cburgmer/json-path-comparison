### Add an implementation

Copy a comparable setup in [./implementations](./implementations) and adapt.
Be aware that some implementations decide to return queries for single values as
scalars, compare
[./implementations/Clojure_json-path](./implementations/Clojure_json-path).

Test the implementation's ninja build script via (using Clojure as an example):

    ninja -f implementations/Clojure_json-path/build.ninja

Test a query by running (again Clojure as example):

    ./src/query_implementation.sh queries/array_slice implementations/Clojure_json-path

### Add a new query

Add a new directory under [./queries](./queries) and give it a `selector` and
`document.json`.

Test a query against an implementation (Goessner's JavaScript as example):

    ./src/query_implementation.sh queries/THE_NEW_QUERY implementations/JavaScript_Goessner

See "One-off comparisons" in the [README.md](./README.md) to execute against all implementations.

[QUERY_NAMING_PATTERN.md](./QUERY_NAMING_PATTERN.md) explains what is a good query
name.

### Upgrade implementations

Some implementations can be automatically upgraded:

    ./src/with_native.sh ./src/upgrade.sh

(Or use ./src/with_docker.sh if you prefer Docker.)

### Clean the build to re-run from scratch

    ./src/clean.sh
