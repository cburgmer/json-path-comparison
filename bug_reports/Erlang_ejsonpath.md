Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[1:3]`
  Input:
  ```
  {":": 42, "more": "string", "a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}

  Expected output:
  ```
  []

  ```
  ["first", "second"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```

  Crash dump is being written to: /dev/null...done
  {"init terminating in do_boot",{badmatch,{error,{1,ejsonpath_parse,["syntax error before: ","':'"]}}}}
  ```

- [ ] `$[1:3:]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["second", "third"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  init terminating in do_boot ({badmatch,{error,{1,ejsonpath_parse,syntax error before: ']'}}})
  
  Crash dump is being written to: /dev/null...done
  {"init terminating in do_boot",{badmatch,{error,{1,ejsonpath_parse,["syntax error before: ","']'"]}}}}
  ```

- [ ] `$[::2]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third", "forth", "fifth"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["first", "third", "fifth"]

  Error:
  ```

  {"init terminating in do_boot",{badmatch,{error,{1,ejsonpath_parse,["syntax error before: ","':'"]}}}}
  ```

- [ ] `$..[0]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", {"key": ["first nested", {"more": [{"nested": ["deepest", "second"]}, ["more", "values"]]}]}]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["deepest", "first nested", "first", "more", {"nested": ["deepest", "second"]}]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  init terminating in do_boot ({badmatch,{error,{1,ejsonpath_parse,syntax error before: '['}}})
  
  Crash dump is being written to: /dev/null...done
  {"init terminating in do_boot",{badmatch,{error,{1,ejsonpath_parse,["syntax error before: ","'['"]}}}}
  ```

- [ ] `$.2`
  Input:
  ```
  {"a": "first", "2": "second", "b": "third"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["second"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  init terminating in do_boot ({badmatch,{error,{1,ejsonpath_parse,syntax error before: 2}}})
  
  Crash dump is being written to: /dev/null...done
  {"init terminating in do_boot",{badmatch,{error,{1,ejsonpath_parse,["syntax error before: ",["2"]]}}}}
  ```
