Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$.2`
  Input:
  ```
  {"a": "first", "2": "second", "b": "third"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["second"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Invalid JSONPath error: 'Error in JSONPath near '.2''
  ```

- [ ] `$[?(@.key<42)]`
  Input:
  ```
  [{"key": 0}, {"key": 42}, {"key": -1}, {"key": 41}, {"key": 43}, {"key": 42.0001}, {"key": 41.9999}, {"key": 100}, {"some": "value"}]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [{"key": 0}, {"key": -1}, {"key": 41}, {"key": 41.9999}]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [{"key": 0}, {"key": -1}, {"key": 41}, {"key": 41.9999}, {"some": "value"}]
  ```

- [ ] `$.['key']`
  Input:
  ```
  {"key": "value"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Invalid JSONPath error: 'Error in JSONPath near '.['key']''
  ```

- [ ] `$..*`
  Input:
  ```
  [40, null, 42]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [40, null, 42]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [[40, null, 42], 40, null, 42]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/PHP_galbar-jsonpath.
