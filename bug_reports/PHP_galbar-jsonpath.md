Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[?(@.key<42)]`
  Input:
  ```
  [{"key": 0}, {"key": 42}, {"key": -1}, {"key": 41}, {"key": 43}, {"key": 42.0001}, {"key": 41.9999}, {"key": 100}, {"some": "value"}]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [{"key": 0}, {"key": -1}, {"key": 41}, {"key": 41.9999}]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [{"key": 0}, {"key": -1}, {"key": 41}, {"key": 41.9999}, {"some": "value"}]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/PHP_galbar-jsonpath.
