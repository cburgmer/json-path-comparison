Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[key]`
  Input:
  ```
  {
    "key": "value"
  }
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [
    "value"
  ]
  ```

- [ ] `$.key-dash`
  Input:
  ```
  {
    "key": 42,
    "key-": 43,
    "-": 44,
    "dash": 45,
    "-dash": 46,
    "": 47,
    "key-dash": "value",
    "something": "else"
  }
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```
  Jsonpath query $.key-dash - Unrecognized expressions after query: dash
  ```

- [ ] `$.2`
  Input:
  ```
  {
    "a": "first",

  Expected output:
  ```

  Actual output:
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```

  ```

- [ ] `$..*`
  Input:
  ```
  [
    40,
    null,
    42
  ]
  ```
  Expected output (in any order as no consensus on ordering exists):

  Actual output:
  ```
  [
    40,
    42
  ]
  ```

- [ ] ``
  Input:
  ```
