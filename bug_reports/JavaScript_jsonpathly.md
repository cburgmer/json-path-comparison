  ```
  ["value"]
  ```
  Actual output:

    "key": "value"
  }
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  NOT_SUPPORTED

  ```
  [
    "value"
  ]
  ```

- [ ] `$[?(@.id==2)]`
  Input:
  ```
  {
    "id": 2
  }
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  []
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [
    {
      "id": 2
    }
  ]
  ```

- [ ] `$[?(@.length() == 4)]`
  Input:
  ```
  [
    [
      1,

  no viable alternative at input '@.length()'
  ```

- [ ] `$.*[?(@.key)]`
  Input:
  ```
  [

      "some": "some value"
    },
    {
      "key": "value"

  [
    {
      "key": "value"
    }
  ]
  ```
