Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$[010:024:010]`
  Input:
  ```
  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [10, 20]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Error: 'Failed to build AST from JSONPath query: $[010:024:010]'
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/PHP_remorhaz-jsonpath.
