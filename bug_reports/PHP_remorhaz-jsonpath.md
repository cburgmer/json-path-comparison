Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$.屬性`
  Input:
  ```
  {"\u5c6c\u6027": "value"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Error: 'Failed to build AST from JSONPath query: $.屬性'
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/PHP_remorhaz-jsonpath.
