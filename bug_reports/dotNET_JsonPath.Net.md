Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$.key-dash`
  Input:
  ```
  {
    "key": 42,
    "key-": 43,
    "-": 44,
    "dash": 45,
    "-dash": 46,
    "": 47,
    "key-dash": "value",
    "something": "else"
  }
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```
  Could not find any valid selectors.
  ```

- [ ] `$.2`
  Input:
  ```
  {
    "a": "first",
    "2": "second",
    "b": "third"
  }
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["second"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```
  Could not find any valid selectors.
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/dotNET_JsonPath.Net.
