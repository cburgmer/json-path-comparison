Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$...key`
  Input:
  ```
  {
    "object": {
      "key": "value",
      "array": [
        {
          "key": "something"
        },
        {
          "key": {
            "key": "russian dolls"
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    "key": "top"
  }
  ```
  Expected output (in any order as no consensus on ordering exists):
  ```
  NOT_SUPPORTED
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [
    "russian dolls",
    "russian dolls",
    "russian dolls",
    "russian dolls",
    "russian dolls",
    "something",
    "something",
    "something",
    "something",
    "top",
    "value",
    "value",
    {
      "key": "russian dolls"
    },
    {
      "key": "russian dolls"
    },
    {
      "key": "russian dolls"
    },
    {
      "key": "russian dolls"
    }
  ]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Haskell_jsonpath.
