- [ ] `$[*]`
  Input:
  ```
  {"some": "string", "int": 42, "object": {"key": "value"}, "array": [0, 1]}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["string", 42, [0, 1], {"key": "value"}]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  []
  ```

- [ ] `$.*.bar.*`
  Input:
  ```
  [{"bar": [42]}]
  ```
  Expected output:

  Actual output:
  ```
  []
  ```

- [ ] `$..*`
  Input:
  ```
  {"key": "value", "another key": {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["string", "value", 0, 1, [0, 1], {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["string", "value", 0, 1, [0, 1], {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}, {"another key": {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}, "key": "value"}]
  ```

- [ ] `$..*`
  Input:
  ```
  [40, null, 42]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  [40, null, 42]
  ```
  Actual output:

- [ ] `$.*`
  Input:
  ```
  ["string", 42, {"key": "value"}, [0, 1]]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["string", 42, {"key": "value"}, [0, 1]]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  []
  ```

- [ ] `$[?(@.key=="some.value")]`
  Input:
  ```
  [{"key": "some"}, {"key": "value"}, {"key": "some.value"}]
  ```

  [{"key": "some.value"}]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
