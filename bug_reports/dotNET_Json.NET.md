Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://cburgmer.github.io/json-path-comparison/):

- [ ] `$..[0]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", {"key": ["first nested", {"more": [{"nested": ["deepest", "second"]}, ["more", "values"]]}]}]
  ```
  Expected output (in any order as no consensus on ordering exists):
  ```
  ["deepest", "first nested", "first", "more", {"nested": ["deepest", "second"]}]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["first"]
  ```

- [ ] `$["key"]`
  Input:
  ```
  {"key": "value"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["value"]
  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Unexpected character while parsing path indexer: "
  ```

- [ ] `$[-1]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["third"]

- [ ] `$..[*]`
  Input:
  ```
  {"key": "value", "another key": {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}}

  ```
  []

  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  []
  ```

- [ ] `$..*`
  Input:
  ```
  {"key": "value", "another key": {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}}
  ```
  Expected output (in any order as no consensus on ordering exists):
  ```
  ["string", "value", 0, 1, [0, 1], {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  ["string", "value", 0, 1, [0, 1], {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}, {"another key": {"complex": "string", "primitives": [0, 1]}, "key": "value"}]
  ```

- [ ] `$..*`
  Input:
  ```
  [40, null, 42]
  ```
  Expected output (in any order as no consensus on ordering exists):

  ```
  Error:
  ```
  Unexpected character while parsing path query: "
  ```
