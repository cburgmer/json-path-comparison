Results do not match other implementations

The following queries provide results that do not match those of other implementations of JSONPath
(compare https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/comparison):

- [ ] `$[1:10]`
  Input:
  ```
  ["first", "second", "third"]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["second", "third"]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  []
  ```

- [ ] `$['0']`
  Input:
  ```
  {"0": "value"}
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  "value"
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  null
  ```

- [ ] `$.*`
  Input:
  ```
  ["string", 42, {"key": "value"}, [0, 1]]
  ```
  Expected output:
  ```
  ["string", 42, {"key": "value"}, [0, 1]]
  ```
  Actual output:
  ```
  [["string", 42, {"key": "value"}, [0, 1]]]
  ```


For reference, the output was generated by the program in https://github.com/cburgmer/json-path-comparison/tree/master/implementations/Ruby_jsonpath.
